# Spawning-TTY-Shell
Often during pen tests you may obtain a shell without having tty, yet wish to interact further with the system. Here are some commands which will allow you to spawn a tty shell. Obviously some of this will depend on the system environment and installed packages.

--- Shell Spawning --- 

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
    echo os.system('/bin/bash')
    /bin/sh -i
    perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
    perl: exec "/bin/sh";
    ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
    lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')

    **(From within IRB)
    exec "/bin/sh"

    **(From within vi)
    :!bash

    **(From within vi)
    :set shell=/bin/bash:shell

    **(From within nmap)
    !sh
